Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down as critical systems became inaccessible.  

Employees also reported seeing a **ransom note** on their screens. The note revealed that an organized group of hackers ‚Äî known for targeting healthcare and transportation sectors ‚Äî had **encrypted the clinic‚Äôs files**. The attackers demanded a **large ransom** in exchange for the decryption key.  

Further investigation revealed that attackers gained access to the network using **targeted phishing emails**. These emails contained **malicious attachments** that installed **malware** once opened.
